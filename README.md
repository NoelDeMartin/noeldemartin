Hi there!

My name is Noel, I am a developer and entrepreneur who loves to learn, solve problems, and build products that make an impact.

I am currently working at [@moodlehq](https://github.com/moodlehq/) 4 days a week and doing side projects the rest of the time (mostly focused on [@solid](https://github.com/solid/) at the moment).

You can find more about me and follow what I'm up to in my website: [noeldemartin.com/now](https://noeldemartin.com/now)
